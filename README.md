This is a simple script to give 4K Video Downloader a bit more functionality while using it as a replacement for JDownloader2 until they fix the YouTube download speed issue.

It adds a basic clipboard monitor for YouTube links (i.e. right-click a link and copy), and it'll rename the video files once downloaded with the channel name before the title so there's some semblance of order (Note: This will download Shorts but won't prefix the channel as it just downloads a login page and I haven't the time to make that work).

It was written in a hurry and is by no means perfect. It's just for personal use but feel free to change it up for your own purposes.
