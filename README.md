This is a simple script to give 4K Video Downloader a bit more functionality while using it as a replacement for JDownloader2 until they fix the YouTube download speed issue.

It adds a basic clipboard monitor for YouTube links (i.e. right-click a link and copy), and it'll rename the video files once downloaded with the channel name before the title so there's some semblance of order.

It was written in a hurry and is by no means perfect. It's just for personal use but feel free to change it up for your own purposes.

Note: *While this will download Shorts it won't prefix the channel for them as it just downloads a login page and I've neither the time nor the incination to make that work for some 60s fluff.*
